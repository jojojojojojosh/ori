# Environment-Specific Redirect Implementation

This document explains how the application handles environment-specific redirects to ensure that local development redirects to local URLs and production redirects to production URLs.

## Implementation Overview

The application now properly handles environment-specific redirects in the following components:

### 1. Authentication Hook (`hooks/use-auth.tsx`)

- **`getRedirectPath()`**: Detects if running on localhost and returns appropriate redirect path
- **`getBaseUrl()`**: Returns correct base URL for OAuth redirects
- **Local Development**: Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_REDIRECT_PATH` (default: `/project`)
- **Production**: Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_REDIRECT_PATH` (default: `/dashboard`)

### 2. Auth Callback Route (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`)

- **Server-side environment detection**: Uses `NODE_ENV === 'development'`
- **Fallback redirect path**: Uses environment-specific paths instead of hardcoded `/project`
- **Production handling**: Properly handles `x-forwarded-host` header for deployed environments

### 3. Implicit Callback Page (`app/auth/implicit-callback/page.tsx`)

- **Client-side environment detection**: Checks `window.location.hostname`
- **Consistent redirect logic**: Matches the same environment detection as auth hook

## Environment Variables

### Development (`.env.local`)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_REDIRECT_PATH=/project
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_REDIRECT_PATH=/dashboard
```

### Production (`.env.production`)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_REDIRECT_PATH=/project
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_REDIRECT_PATH=/dashboard
```

## Redirect Flow

### Local Development
1. User initiates OAuth login
2. Redirect URL: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback?next=/project`
3. After successful auth: User redirected to `/project`

### Production
1. User initiates OAuth login
2. Redirect URL: `https://your-domain.com/auth/callback?next=/dashboard`
3. After successful auth: User redirected to `/dashboard`

## Environment Detection Logic

### Client-side (Browser)
```typescript
const isLocalDev = typeof window !== 'undefined' && 
  (window.location.hostname === 'localhost' || window.location.hostname === '127.0.0.1')
```

### Server-side (API Routes)
```typescript
const isLocalEnv = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests in `__tests__/environment-redirect.test.ts` that verify:

- ✅ Correct redirect paths for development environment
- ✅ Correct redirect paths for production environment
- ✅ Proper OAuth URL generation for both environments
- ✅ Environment detection logic

## Build Verification

The application successfully builds with `npm run build` and all environment-specific logic is properly handled during the build process.

## Key Benefits

1. **No hardcoded URLs**: All redirects are environment-aware
2. **Consistent behavior**: Same logic across all auth flows
3. **Easy configuration**: Environment variables control redirect behavior
4. **Production ready**: Proper handling of production deployment scenarios
5. **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios
